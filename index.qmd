# Set up

1. Install Python on your machine.

2. Install Quarto

3. Go to cmd and type

    - `py --version`
    
    - `py -m pip install pandas plotly statsmodels`
    
    - `py -m pip install palmerpenguins`
    
    - `py -m pip install plotnine`
    
    Note: The reason for typing `py -m` instead of just `pip` install is to avoid issues where you might have multiple versions of Python installed, and pip could be tied to the wrong version. By running `py -m pip`, you're explicitly telling the Python launcher to use the right Python interpreter and its associated pip.

# Loading packages

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import plotnine as p9 
from palmerpenguins import load_penguins
```

# Data

```{python}
penguins = load_penguins()
penguins.head()
```
